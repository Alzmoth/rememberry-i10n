Translate any text while browsing and save it if you wish to memorize it.
Rememberry utilizes innovative scientific researches of human memory and how it works. It was discovered that the most efficient way to keep knowledge in memory is to repeat it exactly at the moment when your brain is ready to forget it. Therefore after learning some foreign word you'll need to repeat it with some increasing intervals. Those intervals are calculated using complex scientific algorithms, which are based on how many times the word was already repeated, and more importantly, how hard for you it was to recall it (in learning sessions you'll be asked to evaluate if it was easy, normal or hard for you). The latter gives our algorithms some clue about specifically yours memory abilities, which provides more accurate intervals value.
